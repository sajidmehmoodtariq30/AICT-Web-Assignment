                <h1>1. Healthcare</h1>
                <p>AI is making healthcare proactive rather than reactive. For example, predictive analytics helps
                    public
                    health authorities anticipate epidemics and allocate resources effectively. Virtual health
                    assistants
                    bridge the gap between patients and doctors by providing immediate support for non-critical queries.
                    Moreover, AI-driven drug discovery is revolutionizing how we combat diseases, leading to faster
                    breakthroughs.

                <p>AI-powered robotics are not limited to industrial automation. For example, in agriculture, robots
                    equipped
                    with AI detect crop diseases and apply pesticides precisely, reducing waste. In healthcare, surgical
                    robots like the da Vinci system allow surgeons to perform complex procedures remotely with
                    unparalleled
                    accuracy. Similarly, in warehouses, AI-enabled robots streamline operations, meeting the demands of
